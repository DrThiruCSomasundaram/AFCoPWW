She has 6 years of research experience in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia-Pacific, focusing on small scale fisheries in the African Great Lakes Region, Mekong River Delta, and Pacific Islands. She is currently a PhD scholar with the Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich UK and lead FAO consultant on the Timor-Leste National Fish Consumption Survey.\nGiven the global paucity of disaggregated aquatic food consumption data, limiting analysis of the aquatic food-nutrition-environmental nexus; Lydia has a strong interest in refining dietary data collection methods to improve data quality of fish consumption using innovative tools such as photographic visual aids to identify species and quantify amount eaten. As a part of her PhD, she is analysing the contribution of aquatic foods to the micronutrient adequacy of women living nearby fisheries in rural Uganda using weighed food records. She is also validating a novel method using mobile phones to remotely monitor dietary quality and fish consumption of hard-to-reach fisheries-dependent households during the wet season when roads become impassable.  \nIn her work with WorldFish and FAO, Lydia contributed to the FAO report “Illuminating Hidden Harvests: the contribution of small-scale fisheries to global food and nutrition security”, helped integrate small fish into the National Feeding Programme in Odisha, India, and was lead author on the FAO report “Pacific food systems: the role of fish and aquatic foods for nutrition and health” for the UN Food Systems Summit.\n\n\n\nKjellevold is a nutritionist at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen, Norway.
